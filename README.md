Repository for the module 3 challenge of the bootcamp

## Description

In this weeks challenge, I needed to finish the JavaScript code for an application that lets a user generate a random password, all based on critera that they have selected. I used if statements, a while and for loop, a try...catch block, prompt(), alert(), and confirm(), as well as creating variables within a function. 

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

This is the inital opening of the app. There is a generate button, and once that is pressed, the program will run.

Once the generate button is pressed, the user will be shown this alert.

Once the user pressed closed, they will enter the amount of characters they would like.

If they do not follow the parameters asked for in the prompt, they will receive this  error, and will be brought back to enter a correct number.

Once the user inputs a correct number for the characters, they will be presented with 4 more prompts to add different variables to their password.

The user is then returned a password that reflects the users input.
